LYRICS  When I was younger I saw my daddy cry And curse at the wind He broke his own heart and I watched As he tried to reassemble it  And my momma swore That she would never let herself forget And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist  But darling, You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception  Maybe I know somewhere Deep in my soul That love never lasts And we've got to find other ways To make it alone Or keep a straight face And I've always lived like this Keeping a comfortable distance And up until now I've sworn to myself That I'm content with loneliness  Because none of it was ever worth the risk  Well you are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception  I've got a tight grip on reality But I can't let go of what's in front of me here I know you're leaving in the morning When you wake up Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream  You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception  You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception  And I'm on my way to believing Oh, and I'm on my way to believing"

What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know anymore... oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh  This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already? I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, but here they come again to jack my style  And that's alright; I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am Oh, who am I? Oh, who am I? mmm... mmm...  Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end Cause I could use some friends for a change And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again Some nights, I always win, I always win...  But I still wake up, I still see your ghost Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh What do I stand for? What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know... (come on)  So this is it? I sold my soul for this? Washed my hands of that for this? I miss my mom and dad for this?  No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on Oh, come on. Oh, come on, OH COME ON!  Well, this is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands This one is not for the folks at home; Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?  My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call  love  But when I look into my nephew's eyes... Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from... Some terrible nights...ahhh...  oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh  The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me I called you up, but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance... oh... It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance... oh..."

Don't you wanna hold each other tight?  Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?   Don't you wanna stay here a little while?  We can make forever feel this way  Don't you wanna stay?   Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast  I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last  When you're on this high, it's a sad goodbye   Don't you wanna stay here a little while?  Don't you wanna hold each other tight?  Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?  Don't you wanna stay here a little while?  We can make forever feel this way  Don't you wanna stay?   Oh yeeah   Oh, you feel so perfect, baby  That it feels so perfect, baby   Don't you wanna stay here a little while?   Don't you wanna stay here a little while?  Don't you wanna hold each other tight?  Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?  Don't you wanna stay here a little while?  We can make forever feel this way  Don't you wanna stay?"

The official music video for 'Grenade' by Bruno Mars from doo-wops and hooligans - available now on Elektra Records!  Directed by Nabil   Today, I get to share with you the visual companion piece to my new single, 'Grenade.' The song is about loving someone so deeply, and the pain of knowing that the person you love does not feel the same. The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate.  -- Bruno Mars  http://brunomars.com  http://facebook.com/thatbrunomars http://twitter.com/brunomars  LYRICS Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?  Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash You tossed it in the trash, you did To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'Cause what you don't understand is  I'd catch a grenade for ya Throw my hand on a blade for ya I'd jump in front of a train for ya You know I'd do anything for ya  I would go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes, I would die for you, baby But you won't do the same  No, no, no, no  Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from Mad women, bad women, that's just what you are, yeah You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car  Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'Cause what you don't understand is  I'd catch a grenade for ya Throw my hand on a blade for ya I'd jump in front of a train for ya You know I'd do anything for ya  I would go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes, I would die for ya, baby But you won't do the same  If my body was on fire Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames You said you loved me, you're a liar 'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby  But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya Throw my hand on a blade for ya I'd jump in front of a train for ya You know I'd do anything for ya  I would go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes, I would die for you, baby But you won't do the same  No, you won't do the same You wouldn't do the same Ooh, you never do the same No, no, no, no"

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else? If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that? Like yea [scratched], check it Travie, I can handle that Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks I used to used to used to, now I'm over that 'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts  If I could only find a note to make you understand I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you  My heart's a stereo It beats for you, so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te Make me your radio And turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo  Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo  Let's go! If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox (remember them?) Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (turn it up) And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me When you have to purchase mad D batteries Appreciate every mixtape your friends make You never know we come and go like on the interstate  I think I finally found a note to make you understand If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you  My heart's a stereo It beats for you, so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te Make me your radio Turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo  Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo  I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me) Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find) I take your hand and hold it closer to mine Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind  My heart's a stereo It beats for you, so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te Make me your radio Turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo  Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo Oh oh oh oh (Gym Class Heroes baby!) to sing along to my stereo   Yeah"
